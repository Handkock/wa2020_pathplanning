@misc{Madkour.2017,
 abstract = {A shortest-path algorithm finds a path containing the minimal cost between two vertices in a graph. A plethora of shortest-path algorithms is studied in the literature that span across multiple disciplines. This paper presents a survey of shortest-path algorithms based on a taxonomy that is introduced in the paper. One dimension of this taxonomy is the various flavors of the shortest-path problem. There is no one general algorithm that is capable of solving all variants of the shortest-path problem due to the space and time complexities associated with each algorithm. Other important dimensions of the taxonomy include whether the shortest-path algorithm operates over a static or a dynamic graph, whether the shortest-path algorithm produces exact or approximate answers, and whether the objective of the shortest-path algorithm is to achieve time-dependence or is to only be goal directed. This survey studies and classifies shortest-path algorithms according to the proposed taxonomy. The survey also presents the challenges and proposed solutions associated with each category in the taxonomy.},

@article{Barnouti.2016,
 abstract = {Pathfinding algorithm addresses the problem of finding the shortest path from source to destination and avoiding obstacles. One of the greatest challenges in the design of realistic Artificial Intelligence (AI) in computer games is agent movement. Pathfinding strategies are usually employed as the core of any AI movement system. In this work, A* search algorithm is used to find the shortest path between the source and destination on image that represents a map or a maze. Finding a path through a maze is a basic computer science problem that can take many forms. The A* algorithm is widely used in pathfinding and graph traversal. Different map and maze images are used to test the system performance (100 images for each map and maze). The system overall performance is acceptable and able to find the shortest path between two points on the images. More than 85{\%} images can find the shortest path between the selected two points.},
